> **WARNING**: The package is still in early stages of development!

`transx` implements several time series operations that follow an opiniated design. The main principle of `transx` is to keep the number of observations the same. Functions that reduce this number have as a default to `fill` the observation gap  (default: NA). However, the user may choose to choose anothe value to fill or even provide a function through
`fill_fun` to achieve the replacement. The `fill_fun` will use the remaining observations as the body of the argument.

## Design Principles

* The input and the output will always be a numeric vector
* The output retains the same length as the input
* Uses a filling logic, where `fill` is used to keep the length of vector identical

Optional, 

* `na.rm`: Which sets`na.rm  = TRUE` by default when needed to.
* `keep.attrs`: Which after manipulations the new series would retain the same attributes.
* `display`: Display informative message for the transformation procedure.

## Installation

 You can install the development version from [Github](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/transx).

``` r
remotes::install_github("transx")
```


### Example 

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(transx)

x <- c(5,3,2,2,5)
lagx(x)
lagx(x, fill = 1)
lagx(x, fill = mean)
lagx(x, fill = fill_nocb)
```
